Home-Improvement


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


* Repair drawers and cabinet doors so that they can be used as normal containers.
* Remove most of the paper debris and turn it into tinder or burn it.
* Allows to remove corpses both indoor and outdoor (use the "place" action)


It should be safe to uninstall this mod at any time.  
Items that have been stored in a repaired container will simply be dropped to the floor.


Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to run.


I recommend using the [Mod-Installer](https://github.com/WulfMarius/Mod-Installer) for installation.  
This mod is part of the "Default Source" and should be available automatically.

For manual installation:  
Extract the contents of the zip into the "mods" directory and also install the latest versions of [AssetLoader](https://github.com/WulfMarius/AssetLoader) and [ModComponent](https://github.com/WulfMarius/ModComponent).
