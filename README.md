Home-Improvement


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


It allows to repair drawers and cabinet doors so that they can be used as normal containers.  
You can also remove most of the paper debris and turn it into tinder or burn it.


It should be safe to uninstall this mod at any time.  
Items that have been stored in a repaired container will simply be dropped to the floor.


Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to run.


I recommend using the [Mod-Installer](https://github.com/WulfMarius/Mod-Installer) for installation.  
This mod is part of the "Default Source" and should be available automatically.

For manual installation:  
Extract the contents of the zip into the "mods" directory and also install the latest versions of [AssetLoader](https://github.com/WulfMarius/AssetLoader) and [ModComponent](https://github.com/WulfMarius/ModComponent).
